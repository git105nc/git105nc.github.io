Installing Atom on Mac

Atom follows the standard Mac zip installation process. You can either press the download button from the https://atom.io site or you can go to the Atom releases page to download the atom-mac.zip file explicitly. Once you have that file, you can click on it to extract the application and then drag the new Atom application into your "Applications" folder.

When you first open Atom, it will try to install the atom and apm commands for use in the terminal. In some cases, Atom might not be able to install these commands because it needs an administrator password. To check if Atom was able to install the atom command, for example, open a terminal window and type which atom. If the atom command has been installed, you'll see something like this:

$ which atom
/usr/local/bin/atom

If the atom command wasn't installed, the which command won't return anything:

$ which atom
$

To install the atom and apm commands, run "Window: Install Shell Commands" from the Command Palette, which will prompt you for an administrator password.
