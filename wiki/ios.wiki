iBackup Viewer [Mac/Windows] – This is the only software that lets you save an unlimited number of SMS and iMessage messages to your computer for free. Your messages can be extracted and saved as a text or PDF file, however, you must purchase the full version to transfer your backup to another device (whether a new iPhone or other smartphone). If you only want to save text messages on your computer and aren’t looking to spend any cash, this is the program for you.
